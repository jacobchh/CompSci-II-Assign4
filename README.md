# Computer Science Fundamentals II - Assignment 4

## Description
For this assignment you will be given a map and you are required to write a program that finds a path from a starting location to a destination, if such a path exists. You are required to find a shortest path from the starting location, the Middlesex College building, to the destination, your house. As the algorithm looks for a shortest path to the destination cell it will keep track of the distance from the current cell to the destination cell.

To execute this program, run ShortestPath.java and it will compute all eight maps present.

## Learning Outcomes
- The solution of problems using circular arrays and queues
- The design of algorithms in pseudocode and their implementation in Java
